        <h1>About This Website</h1>
        <p>This fully-responsive, progressively-enhanced, mobile-first website was built from scratch in the spring of 2014 using Sublime Text and CodeKit, HTML5, CSS3 with SASS/Compass, PHP, Font Custom, a little JavaScript, and a whole lotta love. No templates or prefab frameworks were harmed in the making of this site, however I did borrow some math cues from the Foundation framework&ndash; props to Zurb for some kick-ass SASS.</p>

      <h1>My Experience</h1>

        <h2>&ldquo;Initial Development&rdquo;</h2>
        <img src="img/timeline/win31.jpg" alt="My first computer, a Windows 3.1" class="article">
        <p>I was only six years old but I still remember how excited I was when my family purchased its first computer. My father, brother, and I waited in line for over an hour outside of a Wilmington, Delaware Circuit City on a chilly December morning to buy an AT&amp;T beige box running Windows 3.1. It boasted a state-of-the-art 540 MB Hard Drive and 8 MB of RAM, and it was only $1,099!</p>

        <p>My first foray into computer programming came two years later, and it did not end well. My curiosity for code got the best of me and at the age of nine I broke into MS-DOS, began executing commands, and promptly corrupted the operating system beyond repair. Considering the long wait in the cold only a few years earlier, my father was not impressed.</p>

        <img src="img/timeline/osx.jpg" alt="How far computers have come" class="article">

        <p class="alignRight">Fortunately, I have since learned to apply my fascination in more constructive ways. I taught myself HTML and built my first website when I was twelve. It was full of tables and garish colors, rotating GIF images, auto-playing MIDI files, and blinking text. It is most likely the reason AOL decided to abandon their "AOL Hometown". Nevertheless, throughout high school and college I continued to pursue my passion for web design and development while supplementing my expertise studying traditional graphic design, print design, interactive media, typography, illustration, animation, and marketing.</p>

          <p>With a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, Major in Marketing, Minor in Interactive Media*, from the University of Delaware, I added a business school foundation to my burgeoning love of exceptional design and craftily executed development. Leveraging my knowledge of and experience with design, functionality, feasibility, and business operations perspectives I am able to more effectively conceptualize and produce seamlessly-integrated applications from the planning phase all the way through deployment.</p>
