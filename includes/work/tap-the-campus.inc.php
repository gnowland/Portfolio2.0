The idea for Tap The Campus originated as a Sophomore attending the University of Delaware. Frank Trofa and I identified that there was an untapped opportunity for an online directory of local venues where they could advertise nightly specials and connect with patrons. At this time Twitter, Foursquare, and even Facebook were quickly becoming popular on campus, and restaurant owners had not discovered how to effectively promoting their businesses online.

Frank and I began developing the details of an app that would allow patrons to evaluate a \"heat index\" of the bars in their area all in one place. Users would be able to check-in to a place and tell their friends what they felt about the current ambiance using a \"mood scale\". They could choose to receive notifications about drink specials, event information, and other relevant daily updates. Restaurant owners could manage their directory page, effortlessly allowing them to stay connected with their most valued patrons.</p>
  <p>After pitching a start-up incubator at the Early Stage East conference in Philadelphia in the Summer of 2012 Frank and I were put into contact with Rich, the owner of LoSo. LoSo also provided event notifications and rewards for visiting local venues and had already established itself in the greater Philadelphia market. As the location-based app space was consolidating, and facing fierce competition from services such as Yelp and Foursquare, Frank and I decided to partner with Rich and LoSo.

$result = <<<EOT
We commenced our endeavor for a complete re-brand, redevelopment, and relaunch of Tap the Campus under the LoSo name. We were determined to offer an app that would compete with Yelp and Foursquare, but provide a more focused feature-set that would engage working professionals. We were completed the combination of our original Tap the Campus concept onto the existing LoSo arctetcture, but unfortunately further work on the project has been suspended while negotiations with former investors over original LoSo assets and intellectual property is resolved.</p>
  <p>For the 12-month period the LoSo app was active it had gained local recognition and over 8,000 users in the Philadelphia metro area alone with plans on expanding to other cities within the following year.
