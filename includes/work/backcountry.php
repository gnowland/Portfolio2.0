    <h2>Project Brief</h2>
      <p>While working as a product expert on the sales team at Backcountry.com I recognized that there was an absence of adequate distribution and archival of the internal company newsletter, the Customer Service Bulletin Semi-Weekly (CSBS). I initiated a conversation with the Customer Solutions Department Supervisor and was authorized to lead an operation to digitize the newsletter. I endeavored to maintain its print formatting even though it was extremely tricky to recreate the subtleties in the table-centric Wikitext language.</p>
    <h2>Project Strategy</h2>
      <p>The Customer Service web team suggested that I simply use a screenshot of the PDF files, but I wanted the text to be searchable, editable, and responsive. I wanted to create an attractive gallery archive page with pictures of each issue that linked to the full-text, search-optimized version. Many times I had to code with no preview because the Wikitext tabular formatting would cause the WYSIWYG view to crash. After a few iterations, I succeeded at creating a true-to-format replica of the original printed newsletter.</p>

    <h2>Project Result</h2>
    <p>The customer service department supervisors were extremely impressed with my initiative and I received considerable recognition from upper management. I was further contacted to consult on a SQL database project and later participated in user interface/user experience feedback discussions regarding the public-facing (<a href="http://www.backcountry.com" target="_blank">backcountry.com</a>) product list pages. Although I no longer work for Backcountry.com I am told the distribution of the CSBS continues to be administered using my original workflow and templates to this day.</p>
