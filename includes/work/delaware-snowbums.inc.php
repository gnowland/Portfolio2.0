Shortly after establishing a new on-campus Ski &amp; Snowboard Club the founders of the Delaware SnowBums approached me to design their logo. They wanted a professional logo that would stand out among the hundereds of other socail clubs on campus, reflect their club's playful atmosphere, exhibit the club's "cool factor", and identify the club as university-affiliated.
