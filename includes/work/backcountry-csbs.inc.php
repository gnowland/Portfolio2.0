While working as a product expert on the sales team at Backcountry.com I recognized that there was an absence of adequate distribution and archival of the internal company newsletter, the Customer Service Bulletin Semi-Weekly (CSBS). I initiated a conversation with the Customer Solutions Department Supervisor and was authorized to lead an operation to digitize the newsletter. I endeavored to maintain its print formatting even though it was extremely tricky to recreate the subtleties in the table-centric Wikitext language.

$strategy = <<<EOT
The Customer Service web team suggested that I simply use a screenshot of the PDF files, but I wanted the text to be searchable, editable, and responsive. I wanted to create an attractive gallery archive page with pictures of each issue that linked to the full-text, search-optimized version. Many times I had to code with no preview because the Wikitext tabular formatting would cause the WYSIWYG view to crash. After a few iterations, I succeeded at creating a true-to-format replica of the original printed newsletter.

The customer service department supervisors were extremely impressed with my initiative and I received considerable recognition from upper management. I was further contacted to consult on a SQL database project and later participated in user interface/user experience feedback discussions regarding the public-facing (<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com\" target=\"_blank\">backcountry.com</a>) product list pages. Although I no longer work for Backcountry.com I am told the distribution of the CSBS continues to be administered using my original workflow and templates to this day.
