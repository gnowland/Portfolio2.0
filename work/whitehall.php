        <h1>Whitehall &amp; Company</h1>
        <h2>Project Brief</h2>
        <p>Whitehall's existing website was a static HTML site that Jon, one of the Managing Directors, had created in his spare time. Because Jon designed it himself he was understandably attached to the appearance of the site, but was finding it prohibitively time consuming to maintain its development. Jon wanted to create a system that would allow employees with little to no knowledge of web coding languages to easily publish site content and assist with maintaining the site on a day-to-day basis.</p>
