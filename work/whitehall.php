      <h2>Project Brief</h2>
        <p>When I joined Whitehall their website was a static HTML site that one of the firm's Managing Directors had made. Since he designed it himself he was attached to the appearance but was finding it prohibitively time consuming to add frequent updates to the site. I proposed creating a custom Wordpress-based template that would match the existing site but allow employees with little knowledge of web languages to easily publish content.</p>
