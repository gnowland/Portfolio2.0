    <h2>Project Brief</h2>
      <p>When I joined Whitehall &amp; Company their website consisted of a group of static HTML pages that the firm's Managing Director had made. Since he designed it himself he was attached to the appearance, but was finding it prohibitively time consuming to add updates to the site.</p>
    <h2>Project Strategy</h2>
      <p>I proposed creating a custom PHP template backed by a powerful Content management system. I was confident that following this strategy I could match the aesthetics of the existing site and enable employees with little knowledge of web markup to easily publish content. With Joomla! powering the site I would also be able to develop a custom plugin using Google API to integrate the automated publication of the firm's weekly e-newsletter, Monitoring the Markets, for which I was also in charge of the design.</p>

    </div>
    <h2>Project Result</h2>
    <p>The Whitehall team was highly impressed by how easy changing the website became by using a Content Management System. The weekly e-newsletter archival system contributed to countless hours saved each week and providing historical market snapshots has generated a considerable amount of traffic to the website. At this time the newsletter is seen by over 1,000 influential investors each week.</p>
