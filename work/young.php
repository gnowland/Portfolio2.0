    <h2>Project Brief</h2>
      <p>I was approached by Dan, the Managing Director of Young Consulting Group to perform a total redesign of their existing WordPress site. He specified that the site function like a blog, somewhere he could post frequently to increase his brand reach. He also requested an e-commerce solution be built into the site so he could sell the white papers and other market reports that he published. Finally, he wanted me to initiate a newsletter that he could send to his clients to promote the latest non-profit market research results available on the website.</p>
    <h2>Project Strategy</h2>
    <p>I advised Dan that it would be best to focus on building a <i>responsive</i> website, something with a clean design that would adapt well to whatever size screen the visitor was using. With mobile browsers quickly gaining market share it is imprudent to inconvenience a large percent of potential visitors. I also decided on using MailChimp as the email provider and WooCommerce as the e-commerce platform based on positive past experiences with both of their services.</p>

    <h2>Project Result</h2>
    <p>Dan was extremely pleased with the resulting website. It scales gracefully for all devices and I set him up with powerful e-commerce, e-newsletter, and blogging platforms. I continue to work with him to populate the site with more information and help him bring his Non-Profit consulting expertise to a wider online audience!</p>
